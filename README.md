## 3 Options to Follow Along with the Hands on Modules

### *Option 1.* Links to Notebooks in Google Colab *(preferred)*:

1. [NLP-informed Feature Engineering](https://colab.research.google.com/github/btwooton/DICBWorkshops/blob/nlp-informed-feature-engineering/NLPInformedFeatureEngineering.ipynb)

### *Option 2.* Alternative Links to Run the Notebooks in Binder *(for attendees who do not have Google accounts)*:
**Note: mybinder.org offers significantly resource constrained environments to run interactive jupyter notebooks** \
**so you might run into memory issues while running some or all of the modules, depending on the size of the loaded data**

1. [NLP-informed Feature Engineering](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/btwooton/DICBWorkshops/nlp-informed-feature-engineering?filepath=NLPInformedFeatureEngineering_BINDER.ipynb)


### *Option 3.* Minimal Local Environment Instructions *(for Workshop Attendees who Want to Run Locally)* 

These instructions will help you set up Python, Jupyter, and the necessary packages for the hands-on exercises in this workshop.

### **Step 1: Install Python**  
‚úÖ **Check if Python is already installed**  
Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:  
```sh
python --version
```
or  
```sh
python3 --version
```  
If Python is installed, you‚Äôll see an output like `Python 3.x.x`. If not, follow the next step.  

‚úÖ **Install Python (if not already installed)**  
- **Windows:** Download and install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.  
- **Mac:** Run the following command in Terminal:  
  ```sh
  brew install python3
  ```  
  *(Requires Homebrew. If not installed, visit [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/))*  
- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**  
  ```sh
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
  ```

### **Step 2: Install Jupyter and Required Packages**  
üìå **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)  
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to a directory where you want to store the workshop materials.  
2. Run the following commands:  
   ```sh
   python -m venv workshop_env  # Create a virtual environment
   source workshop_env/bin/activate  # Activate it (Mac/Linux)
   workshop_env\Scripts\activate     # Activate it (Windows)
   ```  

üìå **Install Required Packages**  
1. Download the ZIP file of the workshop repository from the provided link and extract it.  
2. In the terminal, navigate to the extracted folder using `cd <folder_name>`.  
3. Run:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

---

### **Step 3: Start Jupyter Notebook**  
Once installation is complete, launch Jupyter Notebook with:  
```sh
jupyter notebook
```  
This will open a web-based interface where you can run the hands-on exercises.  

---

### **Alternative: One-Step Installation (Without Virtual Environment)**  
If you prefer a simpler setup, you can install everything globally (not recommended):  
```sh
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```  
Then launch Jupyter Notebook with:  
```sh
jupyter notebook
```  

---

### **Troubleshooting**  
‚ùì *Command not found errors?* Try using `python3` instead of `python` or `pip3` instead of `pip`.  
‚ùì *Permission errors?* Use `pip install --user` or run with `sudo` (Linux/macOS).  
‚ùì *Windows users: If `jupyter notebook` doesn‚Äôt work, try running `python -m jupyter notebook`.
